# ProtoLsuEats
First Working iteration of my LSU EATS app
This app allows users to pick preferences for meals around LSU's campus, then based on those preferences, generates a meal for the user. 
The different preferences are location, food type, and price range.
Users can select and deselect multiple preferences.
